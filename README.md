# Bankist
This is project from Udemy course called "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
In main repository I uploaded code for Bankist website that is used as marketing website. It shows all functionalities of bankist app.
In master repository I uploaded code for Bankist app.
Bankist app allows user to log in, delete account, make transaction to another account and request loan. It also displays current balance and all transactions.
After user is inactive for certain amount of time, Bankist app will log out him automatically.
